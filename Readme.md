# Data part

You can find the data-gathering and part of the analysis algorithm in the corresponding folders. Also, you need paid Twitter API to use it, so just enjoy the results:)

# Web app part

```
npm i
```

```
npm run start
```

# Remarks

Also, the raw data and intermediate calculation are close code, case It took long time to gather them and I intend to do a community tool out of it later on.
